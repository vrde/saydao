<h1>Add a member to {CONFIG.name}</h1>

<h2>How to add a member</h2>

<p>
  To add a new member, you must create a <strong>member invite</strong>. A
  member invite is a link you can share with the person you want to invite. A
  member invite can only be used once, so each member needs their own invite.
  You can generate as many invites you need.
</p>

<fieldset>
  <legend>Create a new member invite</legend>
  <form on:submit|preventDefault={createInvite}>
    <label>
      Member id to assign
      <input
        bind:value={memberId}
        type="number"
        name="memberId"
        placeholder="42"
        required
      />
    </label>
    <br />
    <button type="submit">Create member invite</button>
  </form>
</fieldset>

{#if invitation}
  <div>
    <h2>The invite you requested is ready</h2>

    <p>
      Share this member invite with the person you want to invite. You can copy
      and paste it in an email or instant message. Here is sample text you can
      use:
    </p>
    <p>
      Hello friend! You are invited to join {CONFIG.name}. Click the link below
      to join.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong>
      {CONFIG.name} doesn't collect personal information, so it does not record the
      identity of the person connected to a member id. If you want to know who each
      member is, you need to keep track yourself.
    </p>

    <textarea readonly>{invitation}</textarea>
  </div>
{/if}

<details>
  <summary>How does a member invite work?</summary>
  <p>
    A member invite allows one new member to join {CONFIG.name}. Each member
    invite can only be used once. It creates one new member id for one person,
    and then it stops working.
