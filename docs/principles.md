# ParTecK DAO Principles
ParTecK DAO is an experiment in facilitating group decision-making in loosely defined communities. It should operate with the following principles in mind:

## 1. Technological expertise should not be a barrier to participation in a community.
Technology can be a great tool for community organization, but only if the members of the community are comfortable using the technology. Technology that is too complicated could even discourage participation.

SayDAO is designed to be used by participants who have no understanding of the underlying technology. It should not require them to learn how the technology works.

## 2. Technology relied on by communities should run on inexpensive and easily available hardware and software.
While open source software has many advantages, technology that is required for participation in a community should be widely available and widely used.

SayDAO is designed to be used on any laptops, smartphones, or other devices with a camera, an internet connection, and a web browser.

## 2. Many forms of participation in a community are valuable and should be encouraged.
Different modes of participation allow a diverse group of people to bring their skills and knowledge to the community. Incentivizing just one mode of participation could leave out people with different employment situations, living arrangements, family needs, health conditions, or other personal situations that make certain kinds of participation impossible. Online and offline contributions are both important and can play critical roles in a community's success.

SayDAO is designed to allow any form of participation to be rewarded with Say, at the discretion of the community.

## 3. Long-term, ongoing participation in the community should be encouraged.
Institutional knowledge plays a critical role in the success of communities and organizations. Communities should incentivize participants who develop this kind of deep expertise, and should rely on that expertise once it is established.

SayDAO is designed to give additional influence to community members who have participated regularly and over a long period of time. This both encourages ongoing participation and leverages the expertise they have built up.

## 4. Newcomers are vital to a community's long-term health and should be welcomed.
Newcomers to a community bring enthusiasm and fresh ideas. Without them, communities can stagnate. Newcomers should learn how to effectively participate in the community before being given too much influence, but they should not feel excluded by an entrenched group of senior members.

Influence awarded by SayDAO is subject to inflation, so each opportunity to participate in a community gives more influence than the last. This allows newcomers to quickly build up a level of influence that puts them on a more even footing with long-term participants.

## 5. Technology can augment a community's processes or trust within a community, but other rules, laws, or norms are also at play.
A community can agree that decisions will be made using a technological system, but that system still exists within the context of other rules, laws, or norms. Decisions made using the technological system must often be implemented by humans.

SayDAO does not attempt to put the entire operation of a community on-chain. Rather, SayDAO will automate certain key elements, while leaving implementation of decisions made using SayDAO to the members of the community.

## 6. Expect members of a community to act in good faith.
Most members of a community value their standing within that community, and will act with the best interest of the community at heart.

SayDAO starts from the assumption that participants in a community will act in good faith. Since SayDAO tokens can't be traded, participants will have less incentive to look for ways to game the system. This allows SayDAO to focus on usability over security.
