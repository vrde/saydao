# SayDAO Operation

## Definitions
- **Community** means a group that wishes to organize some or all of its activities using SayDAO.
- **Events** means any opportunity for participation in a Community that awards Say to Members who participate in the Event. Events are proposed by Members and a Poll is held to determine whether the Event will be allowed to award Say.
- **ID** means the cryptographic public key associated with a Member in a Community.
- **List** means a list of the Members who attended an Event and will be given Say.
- **Majority** means greater than 50% of Say behind Votes in a Poll.
- **Member** means an individual who is a participant in a Community. A Member is identified by their Key.
- **Notice** means communications sent through a Community's official channels to its Members.
- **Off Chain** means activities, processes, or rules that are not implemented in SayDAO. Off Chain can mean offline or other online processes that are not part of SayDAO.
- **Poll** means a question put to the Members of the Community for a Vote using Say. A Poll can be initiated by any Member of the Community with Say.
- **Quorum** means the number of Members or amount of Say required for the result of a Poll to be accepted as valid. A Quorum is achieved when one third of the Members or one third of the Say has cast a Vote.
- **Revision** means a change to the List by the Supervisor.
- **Revoke** means a decision by the Community to take away a Member's Say.  
- **Say** means a cryptographic token awarded to Members for participation in a Community's Events. Say indicates a Member's influence in Votes held by a Community. Each Member's Say is associated with their ID. Each Community has its own distinct Say tokens.
- **Supermajority** means greater than 66% of Say behind Votes in a Poll.
- **Supervisor** means the Member responsible for recording participation at an Event.
- **Transfer** means a decision by the Community to move a Member's Say from one ID to another.
- **Vote** means a Member's participation in a Poll. Each Member's Vote is given weight according to the amount of Say that Member has.


## Communities
- Communities establish their own rules and processes for Offline activities.

## Membership
- Members of a Community are represented in SayDAO by an ID.
- Anyone can become a Member of a Community by creating an ID.
- A Member's right to participate in the Community can be Revoked by Supermajority.

## Events and Say
- Participation in Events is rewarded with Say.
- Each Event held by a Community rewards participation with more Say than the last Event, according to a formula determined by the Community.
  - *See inflation charts - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pEkx2UZKIDKZs9_eY0snoXh6tkB28-YjLGvqLJD9HSs/edit#gid=0*
- Any Member with Say can propose an Event by initiating a Poll.
- The Supervisor will post a draft List within 24 hours of the conclusion of an Event. Members can review the draft List and request changes.
- After 72 hours, the Supervisor posts a final List and Say is awarded to Members on the List.

## Polls
- Any Member with Say can open a Poll.
- Polls must include:
  - A question to be answered by Members, and
  - A time limit for participation in the Poll.
- Polls to create Events must:
  - Have a time limit of at least one week, and
  - Nominate a Supervisor for the Event.
- When a Poll is opened, the Community must be given Notice of the Poll.
- When a Poll is closed, the Members must be given Notice of the results.
- The Community can Transfer a Member's Say by holding a Poll proposing the Transfer.
  - *Transfer can be used if a Member loses their password and cannot Vote their Say.*
- The Community can Revoke a Member's Say by holding a Poll proposing the revocation.
  - *Revoke can be used if the Community wishes to take away a Member's ability to initiate or Vote in Polls.*
- A Poll is only valid if there is a Quorum of 33% of either all Members or total Say.
- A Poll to Transfer or Revoke is only successful with a Supermajority.

## Poll Results
- SayDAO automatically implements the results of successful Polls to:
  - Create an Event;
  - Transfer Say; and
  - Revoke Say.
- SayDAO does not implement the results of other Polls. Communities must decide how to respond to these Polls Off Chain.
